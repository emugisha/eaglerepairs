                   Gave Harry the model number of the stove. He confirmed he had the oven element needed, which he brought to the job. He installed it and tested to make sure it was working before leaving, This is a rental property and I was able to get the repair done without having to go to the tenant's house.

                   Harry was wonderful! He called within 3 minutes. Discussed the problem and told us what could be wrong. Arrived to repair within 2 hours. Bought the parts and finished the repair within an hour. Where else can you get that kind of service?? On time and for the cost quoted. Would definitely hire again for other jobs.</p>

I felt like I wasted my money for his diagnosis time and got no repair. Harry with Eagle Star came out and with out a gas detector found the problem and was able to take care of it! He even took care of a 2nd appliance is for me at the same time! He was fabulous ! Gave me a great deal! And his service was exceptional. I highly recommend Harry with Eagle Star Appliance Repair!

                   I must admit I was skeptical about using Home Advisors even though two of my coworkers recommended it. I selected Eagle Star from the list of Pro because of the other great reviews. They were right on point. The Eagle Star representative arrived on time, was courteous, knowledgeable, willing to explain what he was doing and why and was quick to get it done. I will be using Home Advisor and Eagle Star again.</p>
